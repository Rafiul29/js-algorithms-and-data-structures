### What is asymptotic notations?

Ans: Asymptotic notation describes the algorithm efficiency and performance in a meaningful way. It describes the behaviour of time or space complexity for large instance characteristics.


### Different types of asymptotic notations

Ans: Big-O Notation (O), Omega Notaion (Ω) and Theta Notation (Θ).


## big o notation

# O(1) - constant
# O(log N) - logarithmic
# O(N) - linear
# O(NlogN) - linear logarithmic
# O(N^c) - poynomial time / c=power
# O(c^n) - Exponential time
# O(n!) - Factorial
